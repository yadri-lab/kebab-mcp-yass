/**
 * Edge-safe bootstrap rehydration for middleware.
 *
 * `first-run.ts` imports `node:fs` for the /tmp persistence layer, which
 * breaks when evaluated under Next's Edge runtime (middleware / proxy).
 * This module is a smaller, Edge-compatible subset: it reads the
 * first-run bootstrap directly from Upstash via the REST API, with no
 * file system access and no module-level state.
 *
 * The goal is to close the consistency gap where middleware would see
 * `process.env.MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` as undefined on a fresh lambda (because
 * the handler rehydrates from KV at request time, but the middleware
 * runs first and has no such path), leading to spurious
 * `/config` → `/welcome` redirects on a fully-initialized instance.
 *
 * Keep this file import-clean: only Web-standard APIs (`fetch`, `JSON`),
 * no Node built-ins, no `@/core/*` imports that might pull fs in
 * transitively.
 */

/**
 * If `process.env.MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is missing on the current lambda and
 * Upstash is configured, fetch the persisted bootstrap and mutate
 * `process.env` so the middleware's auth logic sees a consistent view.
 * Swallows all errors — middleware must never break page serving.
 *
 * On warm lambdas the first check short-circuits, so the Upstash call
 * only fires once per lambda lifetime (or never, if the platform already
 * injected MCP_AUTH_TOKEN via real env vars).
