/**
 * Phase 70 / Plan 01 / Task 2 — Webhook event dispatcher (D-55 / D-63).
 *
 * Routes a verified Unipile webhook payload to the correct handler.
 * Plan 01 ships the dispatcher and 3 NO-OP handler hooks; Plan 02 wires
 * the real handlers by mutating `_handlers.{messageReceived,newRelation,
 * accountStatus}` from a `handlers/index.ts` barrel (side-effect import
 * from the route).
 *
 * Why the hook indirection (mutable object instead of direct imports of
 * `./handlers/...`):
 *   - Avoids cyclic import between the dispatcher and per-event handlers
 *     that will themselves call `resolveTenantFromAccountId` (which lives
 *     in this file).
 *   - Lets Plan 01 ship + be unit-testable BEFORE Plan 02 writes the
 *     real handlers — dispatcher tests spy on `_handlers.X` directly.
 *   - Plan 02 simply imports `{ _handlers }` from this module and assigns
 *     real implementations during the side-effect `import "./handlers"`
 *     in the route. Zero coupling at the type level.
 *
 * Idempotency key derivation (D-54 / Pitfall 7):
 *   Unipile has NO unified `event_id` across event types. `message_id` is
 *   per-message unique for `message_received`. `new_relation` needs a
 *   composite of `account_id:user_provider_id` (Unipile may emit the same
 *   relation row twice if the underlying connection-accept retries). The
 *   `account_status` webhook has NO `event` field at all (detected via
 *   the `account_status` string field); composite key includes a timestamp
 *   so two transitions OK → ERROR → OK on the same account aren't deduped
 *   into a single delivery.
 *
 * Echo-skip (D-63):
 *   `message_received` is delivered for BOTH inbound AND outbound — the
 *   `is_sender: true` flag means it's our own outbound. Inbound enrichment
 *   logic should never see these. Dispatcher drops them with a debug log
 *   (the per-message handler in Plan 02 also double-checks as defense-
 *   in-depth).
