## Ways to Contribute

| Type | What it looks like |
|------|-------------------|
| **New connector** | A new integration with an external service (Linear, Airtable, HubSpot…) |
| **New tool in existing connector** | Add a missing endpoint to Google, Slack, Notion, etc. |
| **Bug fix** | Something isn't working as documented |
| **Docs** | Improve this guide, the README, or inline tool descriptions |
| **Issue triage** | Reproduce bugs, label issues, ask clarifying questions |

Not sure where to start? Check [Good First Issues](#good-first-issues) below.

## Good First Issues

Look for the `good first issue` label on GitHub. These are scoped tasks with clear acceptance criteria and no deep architectural knowledge required.

**Examples of what good-first issues look like:**

- Add a missing tool to an existing connector (e.g., `google_drive_upload`, `slack_reactions`)
- Fix a tool description that is confusing or inaccurate
- Add a contract test for a connector that lacks coverage
- Improve error messages in an existing tool handler
- Add `.env.example` documentation for a new env var

If you want to propose a good first issue yourself, open an issue with the `good first issue` label and a short description.

## Architecture Overview

```
src/
  core/           ← Framework-level code (types, registry, config, auth, logging)
  connectors/
    google/       ← Google Workspace connector (18 tools)
    vault/        ← Obsidian Vault connector (14 tools)
    browser/      ← Browser Automation connector (4 tools)
    slack/        ← Slack connector (6 tools)
    notion/       ← Notion connector (5 tools)
    apify/        ← Apify — LinkedIn + actors (8 tools)
    admin/        ← Admin & Observability connector (1 tool)
```

### Framework vs Instance

**Framework-level** (lives in code, shared by all users):
- Connector manifests, registry logic, types, auth model, dashboard structure

**Instance-level** (lives in env vars, unique per user):
- Secrets, display name, timezone, locale, active connectors

**Rule:** If it's personal or changes per deployment, it MUST be an env var, never hardcoded.

### How a connector activates

1. Connector declares `requiredEnvVars` in its manifest
2. Registry checks at startup: if all required env vars are set → connector activates
3. Tools from active connectors are registered on the MCP endpoint
4. Dashboard, health endpoint, and admin API derive their state from the registry

---

## Adding a Tool

1. Create `src/connectors/<connector>/tools/my-tool.ts`:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

export const myToolSchema = {
  input: z.string().describe("What this input does"),
};

export async function handleMyTool(params: { input: string }) {
  // Your logic here
  return {
    content: [{ type: "text" as const, text: "Result" }],
  };
}
```

2. Add it to the connector manifest (`src/connectors/<connector>/manifest.ts`):

```typescript
import { myToolSchema, handleMyTool } from "./tools/my-tool";

// Add to the tools array:
{
  name: "my_tool",
  description: "What this tool does",
  schema: myToolSchema,
  handler: async (params) => handleMyTool(params as { input: string }),
}
```

That's it. The registry picks it up automatically.

---

## Adding a Connector (step by step)

### Step 1 — Create the directory structure

```
src/connectors/myconnector/
  manifest.ts       ← Connector definition (single source of truth)
  lib/              ← API client, helpers, auth wrappers
  tools/            ← One file per tool
    my-tool-one.ts
    my-tool-two.ts
```

### Step 2 — Write the manifest

```typescript
// src/connectors/myconnector/manifest.ts
import type { ConnectorManifest } from "@/core/types";
import { myToolOneSchema, handleMyToolOne } from "./tools/my-tool-one";
import { myToolTwoSchema, handleMyToolTwo } from "./tools/my-tool-two";

export const myConnector: ConnectorManifest = {
  id: "myconnector",
  label: "My Service",
  description: "What this connector enables (one sentence)",
  requiredEnvVars: ["MYSERVICE_API_KEY"],
  tools: [
    {
      name: "myconnector_action_one",
      description: "What this tool does. Be specific — this text goes in the MCP tool description.",
      schema: myToolOneSchema,
      handler: async (params) => handleMyToolOne(params as Parameters<typeof handleMyToolOne>[0]),
    },
    {
      name: "myconnector_action_two",
      description: "What this tool does.",
      schema: myToolTwoSchema,
      handler: async (params) => handleMyToolTwo(params as Parameters<typeof handleMyToolTwo>[0]),
    },
  ],
};
```

### Step 3 — Write the tools

Each tool file exports a Zod schema and a handler function:

```typescript
// src/connectors/myconnector/tools/my-tool-one.ts
import { z } from "zod";

export const myToolOneSchema = {
  query: z.string().describe("Search query"),
  limit: z.number().optional().default(10).describe("Max results to return"),
};

export async function handleMyToolOne(params: {
  query: string;
  limit?: number;
}) {
  const apiKey = process.env.MYSERVICE_API_KEY!;
  // Call your API here
  const results = await fetchFromMyService(apiKey, params.query, params.limit ?? 10);

  return {
    content: [
      {
        type: "text" as const,
        text: JSON.stringify(results, null, 2),
      },
    ],
  };
}
```

### Step 4 — Register the connector

Add your connector to `src/core/registry.ts`:

```typescript
import { myConnector } from "@/connectors/myconnector/manifest";

const ALL_CONNECTORS: ConnectorManifest[] = [
  googleConnector,
  vaultConnector,
  // ... existing connectors ...
  myConnector,  // ← Add here
];
```

### Step 5 — Document env vars

Add required env vars to `.env.example`:

```bash
# My Service Connector
# Get your API key at: https://myservice.com/settings/api
MYSERVICE_API_KEY=
```

### Step 6 — Write tests

See [Writing Tests](#writing-tests) below.

### Step 7 — Update the README

Add your connector to the Connectors section in `README.md`:

```markdown
### My Service — N tools

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `myconnector_action_one` | Description |
| `myconnector_action_two` | Description |

**Requires:** `MYSERVICE_API_KEY`
```

Also update the tool count in the README header and architecture diagram.

---

## Custom Connector (for your own tools)

If you want to add personal tools without modifying the framework:

1. Create `src/connectors/custom/manifest.ts`:

```typescript
import type { ConnectorManifest } from "@/core/types";
import { myToolSchema, handleMyTool } from "./tools/my-tool";

export const customConnector: ConnectorManifest = {
  id: "custom",
  label: "Custom Tools",
  description: "Your personal tools",
  requiredEnvVars: [], // or your own env vars
  tools: [
    {
      name: "my_tool",
      description: "What it does",
      schema: myToolSchema,
      handler: async (params) => handleMyTool(params as { input: string }),
    },
  ],
};
```

2. Register in `src/core/registry.ts`:
```typescript
import { customConnector } from "@/connectors/custom/manifest";
const ALL_CONNECTORS = [...existing, customConnector];
```

3. Add `src/connectors/custom/` to `.gitignore` if you don't want it tracked upstream.

---

## Deprecating a Tool

Add a `deprecated` field to the tool definition:

```typescript
{
  name: "old_tool",
  description: "This tool does X",
  deprecated: "Use new_tool instead", // Shows warning in dashboard + MCP description
  schema: oldToolSchema,
  handler: async (params) => handleOldTool(params),
}
```

---

## Writing Tests

### Contract tests (required for new connectors)

Contract tests verify tool schemas are valid and tools are registered correctly. Add a contract test for your connector in `src/connectors/myconnector/__tests__/contract.test.ts`:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { myConnector } from "../manifest";

describe("myConnector contract", () => {
  it("has required fields", () => {
    expect(myConnector.id).toBe("myconnector");
    expect(myConnector.label).toBeTruthy();
    expect(myConnector.requiredEnvVars).toBeInstanceOf(Array);
    expect(myConnector.tools.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });

  it("all tools have name and description", () => {
    for (const tool of myConnector.tools) {
      expect(tool.name).toBeTruthy();
      expect(tool.description).toBeTruthy();
      expect(typeof tool.handler).toBe("function");
    }
  });

  it("tool names follow naming convention", () => {
    for (const tool of myConnector.tools) {
      expect(tool.name).toMatch(/^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$/);
    }
  });
});
```

### Running tests

```bash
npm run test:contract   # Contract tests for all connectors
npm run test:e2e        # Full E2E smoke test (starts server, checks tool listing)
npm test                # All tests
```

---

## Code Conventions

- All tool handlers export `{ schema, handler }` pattern
- Every tool is wrapped in `withLogging()` via the registry
- Use `getInstanceConfig()` for timezone/locale, never hardcode
- No personal references in framework code (no "your", "my", specific names in descriptions)
- TypeScript strict mode, no `any` in public APIs
- Tool names: `connectorid_verb_noun` — e.g., `google_calendar_create`, `slack_send`
- Descriptions are generic and explain what the tool does (not who uses it)

---

## Running Locally

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in the credentials for the connectors you want to test
npm install
npm run dev             # http://localhost:3000
```

To test your connector is registered:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
# Should show your connector in the active connectors list
```

Pre-commit hook runs `lint-staged` + contract tests. Fix any failures before pushing.

## Security & supply chain policy

CI runs `node scripts/audit-gate.mjs` on every push and pull request. The gate enforces:

- **FAIL** on any `high` or `critical` vulnerability (any scope).
- **FAIL** on `moderate` direct-dep vulnerabilities unless explicitly allowlisted in `scripts/audit-gate.mjs` with a reason and a `reviewBy` date.
- **WARN** on `moderate` transitive-dep vulnerabilities (often un-fixable without upstream action; tracked, not blocking).

### Adding an allowlist entry

When a direct-dep `moderate` vulnerability cannot be patched short-term (e.g., requires an upstream major-version bump), add an entry to the `ALLOWLIST` array in `scripts/audit-gate.mjs` with:

- `pkg` — the direct-dep package name
- `reason` — the specific CVE/GHSA + mitigation (feature flag, runtime guard, etc.)
- `reviewBy` — a date 3-6 months out when the entry must be re-evaluated

Review expired entries at every milestone boundary.

### Handling a new CVE

1. Confirm with `node scripts/audit-gate.mjs` locally.
2. If direct-dep: bump the package or allowlist with justification.
3. If transitive-dep: open an upstream issue; document in FOLLOW-UP if tracking long-term.
4. If the fix requires a breaking bump, prefer a feature flag (see `KEBAB_BROWSER_CONNECTOR_V2` for the pattern).

## Getting Help

- **GitHub Issues** — bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions** — questions, ideas, show your setup
- **Discord** — real-time chat with maintainers and contributors

If you're not sure whether an idea is a good fit before writing code, open an issue or discussion first. We'd rather align upfront than have you build something that needs major rework.
