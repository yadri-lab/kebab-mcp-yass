/**
 * Welcome wizard — step ordering + gate predicates.
 *
 * Extracted in Phase 45 Task 2 (UX-02b) from the inline `WizardStep`
 * state machine in `app/welcome/welcome-client.tsx` so the truth-table
 * is directly unit-testable (see `tests/ui/wizard-steps.test.ts`) and
 * the step order is declared in one place rather than threaded through
 * JSX conditionals.
 *
 * This module is PURE — no React imports, no DOM access, no fetch. It
 * deliberately carries only a minimal `WelcomeState` shape; the full
 * state machine is defined in `WelcomeStateContext.tsx` (Task 4) and
 * extends this shape with reducer-specific fields (errors, busy flags,
 * ack, etc.). The predicates here answer "can we advance?" given just
 * the wizard-relevant slice of state.
