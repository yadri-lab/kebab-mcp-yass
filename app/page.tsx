  //   - Explicit `INSTANCE_MODE=showcase` → marketing landing (e.g. the
  //     public mymcp-home demo).
  //   - Anything else (real deployments, including fresh forks) → /welcome
  //     to mint the token. The previous logic gated this on
  //     `INSTANCE_MODE=personal` being explicitly set, but Vercel's
  //     fork-then-import flow doesn't set any env vars, so first-time
  //     users landed on the marketing page on their own deploy.
  //     Default-to-welcome makes the zero-config path work.
  //
  // Local dev (`npm run dev`) without a token still hits /welcome, which
  // is the right behavior — the welcome page is what bootstraps state.
  // To preview the marketing landing locally, set INSTANCE_MODE=showcase.
  //
  // Cold-lambda note: on Vercel, the Node-side bootstrap cache is per-
  // process. A cold lambda whose Edge sibling has already warmed up
  // doesn't see the rehydrated token until rehydrateBootstrapAsync()
  // runs in this Node process. Without that, a freshly-minted token
  // living in KV would look "missing" here and we'd send the user back
  // to /welcome on every cold hit. The same pattern is used in
  // app/config/page.tsx — keep them in sync.
