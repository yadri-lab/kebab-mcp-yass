# YassMCP — Development Guide

## Project Overview

Personal MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects Claude to an Obsidian vault stored on GitHub. Deployed on Vercel as a Next.js app.

## Architecture

- **Runtime**: Next.js on Vercel (Edge-compatible, no Node-only APIs in middleware)
- **MCP SDK**: `mcp-handler` wraps `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` for Streamable HTTP
- **Storage**: GitHub repo as Obsidian vault (all vault ops go through GitHub Contents API)
- **Auth**: Bearer token + query string fallback (timing-safe comparison)

## Key Directories

```
app/api/[transport]/route.ts   — MCP endpoint (tool registration + auth)
app/api/health/route.ts        — Health check endpoint
src/lib/github.ts              — GitHub API wrapper (all vault I/O)
src/lib/logging.ts             — Tool call logging decorator
src/tools/                     — One file per tool (schema + handler)
```

## Tools (15 total)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `vault_read` | Read a note (returns frontmatter + body + SHA) |
| `vault_write` | Create/update a note (with optional frontmatter) |
| `vault_append` | Append content to existing note (1 op instead of 3) |
| `vault_batch_read` | Read up to 20 notes in parallel |
| `vault_search` | Full-text search (GitHub Search → tree grep fallback) |
| `vault_list` | List directory contents |
| `vault_delete` | Delete a note |
| `vault_move` | Move/rename a note (atomic read→write→delete) |
| `vault_recent` | Recently modified notes (via commits API, supports `since` filter) |
| `vault_stats` | Vault metrics (note counts, folder breakdown) |
| `vault_backlinks` | Find all notes linking to a given note via `[[wikilinks]]` + forward links |
| `vault_due` | Notes with `resurface:` frontmatter date that has passed |
| `save_article` | Fetch URL via Jina Reader → save with frontmatter |
| `read_paywalled` | Read paywalled articles (Medium cookie support) |
| `my_context` | Load personal context from System/context.md |

## Development

```bash
npm run dev      # Local dev server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build    # Production build
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` | Yes | Bearer token for MCP + admin auth |
| `GITHUB_PAT` | Yes | GitHub PAT with `repo` scope |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | Yes | Vault repo in `owner/repo` format |
| `MEDIUM_SID` | No | Medium session cookie for paywall bypass |

## Conventions

- All tool handlers export `{ schema, handler }` pattern
- Every tool is wrapped in `withLogging()` for observability
- GitHub API calls use `fetchWithTimeout()` (default 10s)
- Path validation: no `..`, no leading `/`, no null bytes
- SHA passthrough: pass SHA from `vault_read` to `vault_write` to skip extra GET
- Frontmatter: parsed/generated with `js-yaml`
- Commit messages: always end with `via YassMCP`

## Deployment

Push to `main` → auto-deployed on Vercel. No CI/CD config needed beyond `vercel.json`.

## Important Notes

- `crypto.timingSafeEqual` is NOT available in Edge Runtime — auth runs in Node runtime only
- GitHub Code Search may not index very small/new repos → `vault_search` has tree grep fallback
- `save_article` max size: 5MB
- `vault_batch_read` max: 20 files per call
- `vault_recent` uses commits API (may require multiple API calls for file details)
- `vault_backlinks` reads all .md files in batches of 10 — can be slow on large vaults
- `vault_due` scans frontmatter for `resurface: YYYY-MM-DD` or `resurface: when_relevant`
- Resurfacing convention: add `resurface:` to any note's frontmatter to make it discoverable by `vault_due`

## Project

**MyMCP — Personal MCP Framework**

An open-source framework that lets technical users deploy a personal MCP server on Vercel in minutes. Users pick which tool packs to enable (Google Workspace, Obsidian vault, Browser automation), configure via a setup wizard, and get a single MCP endpoint that connects to Claude Desktop, Claude.ai, or any MCP client. Built with Next.js/TypeScript, deployed on Vercel free tier.

**Core Value:** One deploy gives you a personal AI backend with all your tools — email, calendar, notes, browser — behind a single MCP endpoint.

### Constraints

- **Stack**: Next.js on Vercel, TypeScript, MCP SDK via `mcp-handler` — no stack changes
- **Deployment**: Must work on Vercel free tier (60s timeout, serverless)
- **Backward compatibility**: Must not break existing tool functionality during refactor
- **Browser tools**: Browserbase dependency for now, but architecture should allow alternatives later
- **Naming**: Keep "Personal MCP" or "MyMCP" branding — open to rename later
- **Simplicity**: Clean, minimal code over feature-rich. Well-designed > feature-complete.

## Full Installation Command
# Upgrade existing
# Setup wizard UI
# OAuth flow
# Dev dependencies (if not already present via shadcn init)
# shadcn components (after init)
## Alternatives Considered
| Category | Recommended | Alternative | Why Not Alternative |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| UI Components | shadcn/ui | Material UI | Heavy, opinionated, npm dependency lock-in |
| UI Components | shadcn/ui | Ant Design | Even heavier, enterprise-focused, not Next.js-native |
| CSS | Tailwind v4 | CSS Modules | Less productive for rapid UI development |
| OAuth | Arctic | Auth.js v5 | Over-engineered for single-user OAuth consent flow |
| OAuth | Arctic | Raw fetch | Security-sensitive PKCE flow shouldn't be hand-rolled |
| Config | mcp.config.ts | cosmiconfig | Overkill — single known config file location |
| Config | mcp.config.ts | JSON/YAML | No type safety, no IDE autocomplete |
| Config storage | Env vars | Vercel Edge Config | Vendor lock-in, free tier limits, wrong abstraction |
| Config storage | Env vars | Database (KV/Redis) | Secrets don't belong in databases, adds cost |
| Tool registry | Filesystem glob | Database | Static config, not runtime-dynamic |
| Forms | React Hook Form | Formik | Legacy, more re-renders, less Next.js integration |
| Toasts | sonner | react-hot-toast | sonner is shadcn's official recommendation |
## What NOT to Add
| Technology | Why Not |
|------------|---------|
| Prisma / Drizzle / any ORM | No database needed. Config is in files + env vars. |
| Redis / KV store | No session state to manage. Serverless = stateless. |
| tRPC | Only 3-4 API routes for the wizard. Plain route handlers suffice. |
| Zustand / Jotai / Redux | Setup wizard state is form-local. No global state needed. |
| next-intl / i18next | English-only for v1. Internationalization is premature. |
| Playwright / Puppeteer | Browser tools already use Stagehand/Browserbase. |
| Stripe / payments | Out of scope — this is a free self-hosted framework. |
| Docker | Target is Vercel deployment. Docker adds complexity for the audience. |
## Architecture Notes for Tool Registry
- Adding a tool = adding one file to `src/tools/`
- Enabling a tool pack = setting `enabled: true` in config + providing env vars
- No manual registration in `route.ts` ever again
## Confidence Assessment
| Technology | Confidence | Reason |
|------------|------------|--------|
| shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4 | HIGH | Dominant pattern, verified via official docs and ecosystem |
| Filesystem tool registry | HIGH | Natural extension of existing `src/tools/` convention |
| mcp.config.ts | HIGH | Standard TypeScript config pattern used by Next.js, Tailwind, Vite |
| Arctic for OAuth | MEDIUM | Well-maintained but less widely adopted than Auth.js. Correct fit for the use case but needs validation during implementation. |
| Env var storage | HIGH | Already the pattern in the project, correct for Vercel serverless |
| React Hook Form | HIGH | Standard for Next.js forms, Zod integration is native |
| @modelcontextprotocol/sdk ^1.29.0 | HIGH | Verified latest stable, widely adopted (40K+ dependents) |
| Vercel API for env vars | LOW | Nice-to-have, adds complexity, needs validation |

## GSD Workflow Enforcement

Before using Edit, Write, or other file-changing tools, start work through a GSD command so planning artifacts and execution context stay in sync.

Use these entry points:
- `/gsd:quick` for small fixes, doc updates, and ad-hoc tasks
- `/gsd:debug` for investigation and bug fixing
- `/gsd:execute-phase` for planned phase work

Do not make direct repo edits outside a GSD workflow unless the user explicitly asks to bypass it.
