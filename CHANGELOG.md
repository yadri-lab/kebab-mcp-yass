# Changelog

All notable changes to MyMCP.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- `.husky/pre-commit` now blocks accidental commits of `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.vercel`, etc. (the `.env.example` template stays whitelisted). Closes audit R6.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` adopting the Contributor Covenant 2.1 by reference, with a project-specific reporting contact and enforcement statement. Linked from `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Closes audit R1.
- User-facing GitHub issue templates: `bug_report.yml`, `feature_request.yml`, `config.yml` (disables blank issues, surfaces SECURITY.md and Discussions). The existing dev templates (`new-connector.md`, `new-tool.md`) are preserved unchanged. Closes audit R2.
- `SECURITY.md` gains a "Token rotation" section walking through Vercel multi-token zero-downtime, Docker, and local dev rotation flows with concrete commands and verification steps. Closes audit C3 procedural follow-up.

### Security

- **Resolved 3 dependency vulnerabilities** via `npm audit fix`:
  - `protobufjs` 7.5.4 → 7.5.5 — **CRITICAL** arbitrary code execution (GHSA-xq3m-2v4x-88gg), pulled by `@browserbasehq/stagehand → @google/genai` and by `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http`
  - `basic-ftp` 5.2.2 → 5.3.0 — **HIGH** DoS via unbounded memory in `Client.list()`, pulled via `stagehand → puppeteer-core → proxy-agent`
  - `hono` 4.12.12 → 4.12.14 — moderate JSX SSR HTML injection, pulled via `mcp-handler → @modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
- `npm audit --audit-level=high` (the CI gate) now exits 0 again
- **Recommended**: rotate your `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` if you've shared this repo or your `.env` file with anyone (audit hygiene; no leak detected — the verification confirmed `.env` was never committed to history)

### Known residuals (3 moderates)

These cannot be patched without a semver-major downgrade of `@browserbasehq/stagehand` (3.2.1 → 3.1.0), which would regress the browser connector. Tracked upstream:

- `langsmith` SSRF + prototype pollution + token-redaction bypass
- `@langchain/core` (parent of `langsmith`)
- `@browserbasehq/stagehand` (parent of `@langchain/core`)

Will close when stagehand publishes a release using a patched langchain stack.

### Changed

- 11 minor dependency bumps surfaced by `npm outdated`:
  - **Production**: `next` 16.2.3 → 16.2.4, `react` + `react-dom` 19.2.4 → 19.2.5, `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http` + `@opentelemetry/sdk-node` 0.214 → 0.215
  - **Dev**: `typescript` 6.0.2 → 6.0.3, `eslint` 10.2.0 → 10.2.1, `prettier` 3.8.2 → 3.8.3, `fast-check` 4.6 → 4.7, `@types/node` 25.5 → 25.6, `typescript-eslint` 8.58.1 → 8.58.2
- **Skipped**: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.26 → 1.29. The bump initially landed but was reverted because `mcp-handler@1.1.0` hard-pins SDK 1.26.0 as a peer dependency. Awaiting `mcp-handler` 1.2+ release.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Vercel auto-magic mode** — when `VERCEL_TOKEN` and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` are configured, `/api/welcome/init` now also writes the minted `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` to Vercel via REST API and triggers a production redeploy. The welcome page shows a 3-step progress UI ("Token generated → Written to Vercel → Redeploying...") and the dashboard becomes permanent without any manual paste step. Falls back gracefully to manual paste when unavailable. Same auto-magic path is wired into the dry-run banner's "Generate token" CTA.
- **Setup health widget** in the dashboard overview tab — shows token status (Permanent / Bootstrap / Unconfigured), Vercel auto-deploy availability, and the instance endpoint at a glance. New endpoint `GET /api/config/health` (admin auth).
- **Dry-run dashboard mode** — claim-cookie holders can navigate to `/config` directly from the welcome page (via "Or explore the dashboard first →" link) to configure connectors before minting a token. A sticky amber banner appears across all dashboard pages reminding them to generate the token, with an inline "Generate token" CTA that triggers the welcome init flow.
- **Recovery escape hatch** — set `MYMCP_RECOVERY_RESET=1` in env vars and redeploy to wipe stale bootstrap state when locked out. Surfaced via a subtle expandable footer on the welcome page.
- **Optional KV cross-instance bootstrap persistence** — when an external KV store is configured (Upstash, or off-Vercel filesystem KV), bootstrap state is mirrored to the same KV abstraction used by rate-limit so cold-starts on different instances re-hydrate the same claim. Falls back transparently to /tmp-only persistence on Vercel without Upstash.
- **End-to-end integration tests** for the welcome flow covering happy path, locked-out visitor, forged cookies, MCP endpoint guard, recovery reset, and auto-magic mode (mocked Vercel API).

### Changed

- `app/api/welcome/{claim,init,status}/route.ts` now `await rehydrateBootstrapAsync()` at handler entry to pull KV state when available.
- `__internals` no longer exposes `COOKIE_NAME` and `CLAIM_TTL_MS` — they're proper exports as `FIRST_RUN_COOKIE_NAME` and `CLAIM_TTL_MS`.
- `first-run.ts` now logs structured `[MyMCP first-run]` info messages on claim creation, bootstrap mint, and re-hydration for production observability.
- Vitest config now runs test files sequentially (`fileParallelism: false`) to avoid races on shared OS `/tmp` paths used by the first-run bootstrap state.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Zero-config Vercel onboarding** — the "Deploy to Vercel" button no longer requires `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` or `MYMCP_DISPLAY_NAME` to be filled in upfront. After deploy, visitors are routed to a new `/welcome` page that mints a permanent token via an in-memory bridge (process.env mutation + `/tmp` persistence + signed first-run claim cookie), so the dashboard works immediately on the same instance. The page then walks the user through pasting the token into Vercel and redeploying for permanence, and polls `/api/welcome/status` to detect when the env var is set "for real."
- New module `src/core/first-run.ts` exposing `isFirstRunMode`, `isBootstrapActive`, `getOrCreateClaim`, `isClaimer`, `bootstrapToken`, `clearBootstrap`, and `rehydrateBootstrapFromTmp`.
- New API routes: `/api/welcome/claim`, `/api/welcome/init`, `/api/welcome/status`.
- Shared `src/core/request-utils.ts` with `isLoopbackRequest` (extracted from `app/api/setup/save/route.ts`).

### Security

- **Closed the first-run admin auth bypass** — `checkAdminAuth` previously returned `null` (open access) whenever no admin token was configured, leaving fresh public Vercel deploys exposed. It now requires either a loopback request OR a valid first-run claim cookie when no token is set; all other requests get 401.
- The MCP endpoint (`/api/[transport]`) now refuses traffic with `503 Instance not yet initialized` while in first-run mode, instead of accepting open requests.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- **Landing page header CTA** — replaced ambiguous "Login" button (which pointed to `/setup` and made no sense on the marketing landing) with **"Open my instance"**, a popover that asks for the user's deployed instance URL, validates it, persists it in `localStorage`, and redirects to `{url}/config`. Subsequent visits one-click straight through. Includes a "Forget saved instance" escape hatch and a "Don't have one yet? Deploy →" link that anchors to the hero deploy section.
